#generator-ngappgen

>Yeoman Generator for Enterprise Angular Projects

This generator follows the [Angular Best Practice Guidelines for Project Structure](http://blog.angularjs.org/2014/02/an-angularjs-style-guide-and-best.html).

Features

* Provides a directory structure geared towards large Angular projects.
    * Each controller, service, filter, and directive are placed in their own file.
    * All files related to a conceptual unit are placed together.  For example, the controller, HTML, LESS, and unit test for a template are placed together in the same directory.
* Provides a ready-made Grunt build that produces an extremely optimized distribution.
   * Build uses [grunt-ngmin](https://github.com/btford/grunt-ngmin) so you don't have to use the Angular injection syntax for safe minification (i.e. you dont need `$inject` or `(['$scope','$http',...`.
   * `grunt serve` task allows you to run a simple development server with watch/livereload enabled.  Additionally, JSHint and the appropriate unit tests are run for the changed files.
* Integrates Bower for package management
* Includes Yeoman subgenerators for directives, services, templates, controllers, filters, and modules.
* Integrates LESS and includes Bootstrap via the source LESS files allowing you to reuse Bootstrap vars/mixins/etc.
* Easily Testable - Each sub-generator creates a skeleton unit test.  Unit tests can be run via `grunt test` and they run automatically during the grunt watch that is active during `grunt serve`.

Directory Layout
-------------
All subgenerators prompt the user to specify where to save the new files.  Thus you can create any directory structure you desire, including nesting.  The generator will create a handful of files in the root of your project including `index.html`, `app.js`, and `app.less`.  You determine how the rest of the project will be structured.

In this example, the user has chosen to group the app into an `admin` folder, a `search` folder, and a `service` folder.


    app.less ....................... main app-wide styles
    app.js ......................... angular module initialization and route setup
    index.html ..................... main HTML file
    Gruntfile.js ................... Grunt build file
    /admin ......................... example admin module folder
      admin.js ..................... admin module initialization and route setup
      admin.less ................... admin module LESS
      /admin-directive1 ............ angular directives folder
        admin-directive1.js ........ example simple directive
        admin-directive1-spec.js.... example simple directive unit test
      /admin-directive2 ............ example complex directive (contains external template)

    /bower_component................ 3rd party libraries managed by bower

Getting Started
-------------

Prerequisites: Node, Grunt, Yeoman, and Bower.  Once Node is installed, do:

    npm install -g grunt-cli yo bower

Next, install this generator:

    npm install -g generator-ngappgen

To create a project:

    mkdir MyApp
    cd MyApp
    yo ngappgen

Grunt Tasks
-------------

Now that the project is created, you have 3 simple Grunt commands available:

    grunt serve   #This will run a development server with watch & livereload enabled.
    grunt test    #Run local unit tests.
    grunt build   #Places a fully optimized (minified, concatenated, and more) in /dist

When `grunt serve` is running, any changed javascript files will be linted using JSHint as well as have their appropriate unit tests executed.  Only the unit tests that correspond to the changed file will be run.  This allows for an efficient test driven workflow.

Yeoman Subgenerators
-------------

There are a set of subgenerators to initialize empty Angular components.  Each of these generators will:

* Create one or more skeleton files (javascript, LESS, html, spec etc) for the component type.
* Update index.html and add the necessary `script` tags.
* Update app.less and add the @import as needed.
* For templates, update the app.js, adding the necessary route call if a route was entered in the generator prompts.

There are generators for `directive`, `template`, `service`, `filter`, `module`, `controller` and `modal`.

Running a generator:

    yo ngappgen:directive my-awesome-directive
    yo ngappgen:template my-template
    yo ngappgen:service my-service
    yo ngappgen:service my-controller
    yo ngappgen:filter my-filter
    yo ngappgen:module my-module
    yo ngappgen:modal my-modal

The name paramater passed (i.e. 'my-awesome-directive') will be used as the file names.  The generators will derive appropriate class names from this parameter (ex. 'my-awesome-directive' will convert to a class name of 'MyAwesomeDirective').  Each sub-generator will ask for the folder in which to create the new skeleton files.  You may override the default folder for each sub-generator in the `.yo-rc.json` file.

The modal subgenerator is a convenient shortcut to create templates that work as modals for Bootstrap v3.1 and Angular-UI-Bootstrap v0.10 (both come preconfigured with this generator).  If you choose not to use either of these libraries, simply don't use the modal subgenerator.

Subgenerators are also customizable.  Please read [CUSTOMIZING.md](CUSTOMIZING.md) for details.

Submodules
-------------

Submodules allow you to more explicitly separate parts of your application.  Use the `yo ngappgen:module my-module` command and specify a new subdirectory to place the module into.  Once you've created a submodule, running other subgenerators will now prompt you to select the module in which to place the new component.

Preconfigured Libraries
-------------

The new app will have a handful of preconfigured libraries included.  This includes Angular 1.2, Bootstrap 3, AngularUI Bootstrap, AngularUI Utils, FontAwesome 4, JQuery 2, Underscore 1.5, LESS 1.6, and Moment 2.5.  You may of course add to or remove any of these libraries.  But the work to integrate them into the app and into the build process has already been done for you.

Build Process
-------------

The project will include a ready-made Grunt build that will:

* Build all the LESS files into one minified CSS file.
* Uses [grunt-angular-templates](https://github.com/ericclemmons/grunt-angular-templates) to turn all your templates into Javascript.
* Uses [grunt-ngmin](https://github.com/btford/grunt-ngmin) to preprocess all Angular injectable methods and make them minification safe.  Thus you don't have to use the array syntax.
* Concatenates and minifies all Javascript into one file.
* Replaces all appropriate script references in `index.html` with the minified CSS and JS files.
* Minifies any images in `/img`.
* Minifies the `index.html`.
* Copies any extra files necessary for a distributable build (ex.  Font-Awesome font files, etc).

The resulting build loads only a few highly compressed files.

The build process uses [grunt-dom-munger](https://github.com/cgross/grunt-dom-munger) to pull script references from the `index.html`.  This means that **your index.html is the single source of truth about what makes up your app**.  Adding a new library, new controller, new directive, etc does not require that you update the build file.  Also the order of the scripts in your `index.html` will be maintained when they're concatenated.

Importantly, grunt-dom-munger uses CSS attribute selectors to manage the parsing of the script and link tags.  Its very easy to exclude certain scripts or stylesheets from the concatenated files. This is often the case if you're using a CDN. This can also be used to prevent certain development scripts from being included in the final build.

* To prevent a script or stylesheet from being included in concatenation, put a `data-concat="false"` attribute on the link or script tag.  This is currently applied for the `livereload.js` and `less.js` script tags.

* To prevent a script or link tag from being removed from the finalized `index.html`, use a `data-remove="false"` attribute.
